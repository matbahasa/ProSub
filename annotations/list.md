# List of prosub annotations

- If the corpus/text is not open, we can only provide the annotation file.  You need to obtain the corpus/text file(s) by yourself.
- We developed a tool to combine the corpus and annotation files easily: [ETA: Easy Text Annotator]((https://github.com/matbahasa/ETA)).
