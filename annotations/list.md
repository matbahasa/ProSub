# List of prosub annotations

- The annotation is provided in the tab-delimited text format and the jsonl format for open corpora.
- For closed corpora, we can only provide the tab-delimited text format annotation file, as we cannot redistribute the texts in them.  You need to obtain the corpus file(s) and combine the corpus and annotation files by yourself.
- We developed a tool to combine the corpus and annotation files easily: [ETA: Easy Text Annotator](https://github.com/matbahasa/ETA).
